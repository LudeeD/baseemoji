  <h1><code>Base Emoji</code></h1>

## What ?

Basically a funny encode mechanism, which transform bytes into emogis.

## How ?

There is no big or clever algorithm behind.
I just choose 255 emogis that I like and then map bytes to them.

The fancy part is the use of Rust/WebAssembly to do the encoding and decoding.

## Why ?
